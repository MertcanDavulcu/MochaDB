With this module, you update or view your current directory. <br>
When you use the module alone, it shows you your current directory.
If you write content, it will also add that directory above your existing directory.
To get up one directory, you need to use double dot in a row. <br>
Example: <br>

```
desktop\foo cd
desktop\foo
desktop\foo cd ..
desktop cd foo
desktop\foo cd ..\foo\bar
desktop\foo\bar 
```
